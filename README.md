# keycloak up and running
Simple dockerized KeyCloak. 
To start experimenting, uncomment the temporary KeyCloak password in the docker-compsoe.yaml file and run
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Change admin password, comment it again in the docker-compose.yaml file and enable 2FA in the admin console.
Enjoy
